# 🔄 Pipeline

This page walks through what MMIRAGE actually does when you run `mmirage run`.
It covers the full lifecycle of a pipeline from config loading to final output.

For background on terms used here, see [Concepts](concepts.md).

## Stage 1 — Config loading

MMIRAGE reads the YAML file you pass to `--config` and constructs a typed
`MMirageConfig` object.

During loading:

- `${ENV_VAR}` references in string values are expanded from the process environment.
- The raw dict is validated and cast to typed dataclasses via `dacite`.
- `shard_id` set to `"$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID"` is resolved to the integer value
  of that environment variable at load time.

If required fields are missing or types do not match, MMIRAGE reports a clear
error before doing any work.

---

## Stage 2 — Dataset loading

Each entry in `loading_params.datasets` is passed to the appropriate
**DataLoader** based on its `type` field:

| `type` | Loader | Source format |
|---|---|---|
| `JSONL` | `JSONLDataLoader` | Plain `.jsonl` file, one JSON object per line |
| `loadable` | `LocalHFDataLoader` | HuggingFace `Dataset` saved with `save_to_disk` |

Multiple datasets can be listed; they are concatenated into one in-memory dataset
before sharding.

---

## Stage 3 — Sharding

The combined dataset is split into `num_shards` non-overlapping slices.
Only the slice corresponding to `shard_id` is processed.

This means if you run `mmirage run` locally with `num_shards: 4`, it processes
only shard 0 by default (or the shard specified with `--shard-id`).
On SLURM, each array task runs with a different `shard_id`, so all shards are
processed in parallel.

---

## Stage 4 — Mapping (per batch)

The heart of MMIRAGE is the **mapper**, which processes the shard in batches.
For each batch:

### 4a. Extract input variables

Each sample in the batch is inspected.
For each `InputVar` defined in `processing_params.inputs`, MMIRAGE applies
the JMESPath expression to the sample dict and stores the result by variable name.

For `type: image` inputs, the extracted value (a filename or relative path) is
resolved to an absolute path using `image_base_path`, then optionally loaded
as a PIL Image.

### 4b. Run the processor

For each `OutputVar` in `processing_params.outputs`, MMIRAGE:

1. Renders the prompt template with all currently available input variables.
2. Passes the rendered prompt (and any image inputs) to the configured processor.
3. Stores the model's response under the output variable's name.

The processor is the SGLang engine (for local inference) or a provider batch
API orchestrator (for batch mode).

If `output_type: JSON`, the response is parsed as JSON before storage. A response
that fails to parse is stored as an empty dict and logged as a warning carrying a
truncated copy of the raw output; the full text is logged at `DEBUG`.

When the output variable declares typed fields or `min`/`max` bounds, the parsed
value is validated against the full schema after decoding (missing fields, type
mismatches, and bound violations). Failures are logged as a warning and the
parsed value is stored unchanged, nothing is clamped or discarded.

A `custom` output skips the prompt step entirely: the row's variables are passed
as a dictionary to your Python function, running in a separate process pool
(see [Custom Module](custom_module.md)).

### 4c. Render the output schema

Once all output variables are computed, the `TemplateRenderer` applies the
`output_schema` Jinja2 template to produce the final sample dict.

Each field in the schema that is a plain `{{ var }}` reference is substituted
directly (preserving the original Python type — list, dict, PIL Image, etc.).
Fields with complex Jinja2 expressions are fully rendered as strings.

---

## Stage 5 — Atomic write

After all batches in a shard are processed, the result is saved to disk.

MMIRAGE uses a **temp-then-rename** strategy:

1. The processed dataset is written to a temporary directory with a unique
   name (`<output_dir>/shard_<id>.<host>.<pid>.<uuid>`).
2. Once writing succeeds, the temp dir is atomically renamed to
   `<output_dir>/shard_<id>/`.

This guarantees that a partially written shard never looks complete, and that
concurrent writes from multiple nodes on a shared filesystem do not collide.

---

## Stage 6 — State marker

After the shard finishes (success or failure), MMIRAGE writes a `status.json`
file to `<state_dir>/shard_<id>/`:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "retry_count": 1
}
```

This file is read by the orchestrator to determine which shards need retrying.

---

## Stage 7 — Orchestration

After all shards have been submitted and finished and if `retry` is set to `true`, the CLI orchestrator:

1. Reads every `status.json` file.
2. Resubmits any failed shard (up to `max_retries` attempts).
3. Once all shards succeed (or the retry budget is exhausted), optionally
   runs `merge_shards` to combine all `shard_<id>/` directories into a
   single dataset at `<output_dir>/merged/`.

On SLURM, the orchestrator polls `squeue` to detect when the job has left the queue before
reading state files.

---

## Execution mode summary

| Mode | How shards run | Orchestrator |
|---|---|---|
| `local` | Runs a single shard locally (defaults to shard 0; select with `--shard-id`) | Python CLI loop |
| `slurm` | sbatch array, one task per shard on dedicated nodes | Polls `squeue` |
