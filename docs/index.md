MMIRAGE is an open-source platform for large-scale dataset processing using large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs).

It provides a declarative, YAML-driven pipeline to extract variables from data samples, construct prompts, run model inference, render structured outputs, and distribute the work across shards — locally or on HPC clusters via SLURM.

---

## What is MMIRAGE?

MMIRAGE lets you transform large datasets using generative models by:

- extracting named variables from each sample with JMESPath queries
- constructing prompts with Jinja2 templates
- running inference locally via a SGLang engine, or asynchronously via a provider batch API (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- rendering processed outputs into any JSON schema you define
- splitting work across shards with automatic resume, retry, and merge

It natively supports text and image inputs, SLURM-based cluster execution, throughput benchmarking, and atomic crash-safe writes.

## Where to start

Depending on what you want to do, start in different places:

- to install MMIRAGE, read [Installation](installation.md)
- to run a first pipeline end to end, read [Quickstart](quickstart.md)
- to understand core concepts and terminology, read [Concepts](concepts.md)
- to understand the full pipeline data flow, read [Pipeline](pipeline.md)
- to process images with a VLM, read [Multimodal Processing](multimodal.md)
- to generate images from dataset prompts, read [Image Generation](image_generation.md)
- to run at scale on a cluster, read [SLURM & Cluster Deployment](slurm.md)
- to use a provider batch API, read [Batch API](batch_api.md)
- to use your custom python module, read [Custom Module](custom_module.md)
- to measure throughput and GPU efficiency, read [Benchmarking](benchmarking.md)
- to configure every parameter, read [Configuration Reference](configuration.md)
- to work on the codebase locally, read [Developer Guide](developer.md)
